### 💡 Why This Project Exists

I created this project for one simple reason: **I want to race, not browse**.

* I **hate using a browser** when I'm already in a gaming mindset.
* The **Content Manager (CM)** is powerful, but **too cluttered** when it comes to quickly finding No Hesi servers.

The No Hesi Server Browser is my personal solution:
a **minimal, fast, focused** desktop app that shows me only what I care about – and nothing more.
